# Up-in-the-Air:
## An Exploration of the Airline Industry, Flight Delays, and the Purchase of Flight Insurance through the Blockchain
![airplane](airplane.jpg)

## Required Python Dependencies 
-	A requirements file to manage external dependencies (that are not included with a standard Python installation) used to run the app is made available [HERE](requirements.txt)
-	Recommendation: Install the Python packages listed in the requirements file in a [virtual environment]( https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#optionally-create-a-virtual-environment), rather than installing them globally. 
-	The following command can be used to use pip to install the necessary Python Packages through the terminal for Mac: <p> python3 -m pip install "PackageName==Version" </p>
-- For example, in order to install [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) use: pip install streamlit==0.82.0
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) and [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) are also required in order to run and test the app locally. 

## Real-time Flight Status & Global Aviation Data API
- In order to access and retrieve global flight tracking data in real-time, we utilized [Aviationstack.](https://aviationstack.com/) A free API key is available for up to 500 requests. 
- Pictured below is a request to search for all flights departing from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD)

## Dashboard Web Application
- This repository contains a [Python script](streamlit_app.py) which is used to create a Webapp that has been deployed and is publicly available for viewing [HERE]( https://share.streamlit.io/rawnakmahjabib/up-in-the-air/main)
- The application is a dashboard that allows Users to locate real-time flights, view estimated departure/arrival times, whether or not a flight is delayed, and analyze public sentiment surrounding the airline industry through Tweets üê¶. Users are given the ability to purchase flight insurance through their Ether wallets and can claim their pay-outs using our Webapp.

### User Interface Design 
![User Interface](user-interface1.png)

### Navigating the Sidebar (located on the far-left of the Webapp)
- By making different selections through the use of the radio button, Users are able to view random tweets containing either positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. Pictured below are examples of tweets containing positive and negative sentiment, respectively. <br>
![Positive Tweet Sentiment](random-pos-sentiment.png)
![Negative Tweet Sentiment](random-neg-sentiment.png)
- The sentiment data reveals that substantial flight delays are a common theme amongst airline customer complaints. 
- Users are also able to view different types of data visualization (i.e. Histogram or Pie Chart) depending on their preference by interacting with the selectbox. The checkbox can be clicked to hide or display the chosen visual. The visualizations were created using [Plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) and are pictured below: <br>

![Pie Chart](piechart.png)
#### Tweet Locations (Based on the time of day)
- Users can interact with the slider to view the number of airline-related tweets during the selected hour of the day along with the regions the tweets are originating from. Using Streamlit's syntax "st.map()", the Webapp displays the data points on a map as pictured below: <br>
![Tweet Locations](tweet-locations.png)
#### Airline Comparison Tool
- The multiselect dropdown enables Users to select various U.S. Airlines and compare the number of tweets, categorized by sentiment, in relation to the other. Pictured below is a comparison of United, Delta, and American Airlines. <br>

#### Wordclouds Based on Sentiment 
- Use of the radio button, allows Users to populate and display a [WordCloud](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/generated/wordcloud.WordCloud.html) based on positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. Pictured below is a WordCloud visual representation of words associated with negative customer complaints. 
- One can see below that there are variious phrases indicatiing that customers are expressing concerns regarding flight delays - such as "late flight," "delay," "delayed," etc.

## Successfully Purchasing Flight Insurance through the Webapp. 
- Once the form required to buy insurance is filled out properly - by providing a first/last name, ticket # (for testing purposes, a User can enter a random series of numbers), airline code, flight number, departure date, and testETH wallet information - and submitted, the transaction can be verified on the local Ganache Workspace. Picture below is a successful purchase of flight insurance on our personal blockchain:

## Spoiled by Choice
#### Integrating Machine Learning
- During the exercise of brainstorming about the ideas we thought of trying and one of them was predicting future delays. The steps needed were:
1. Flight information that has been collected
2. Weather API
- A simplified way would have been to slice the flight and weather data by horizons (Northeast/Southwest/East/North...etc) and change rain/snow/fog to 1 and every other fair weather to 0, put the airline as dummy code and solve for y which would be either the departure delay or more importantly the arrival delay. Then there run a Random Forrest Algorthim and try to see the results of our predictions which may not have been accurate for the following reasons:

- The original hypothesis is that weather controls most of the delays but that is flawed. Air traffic can be caused by a myrid of things from an airport employee not stocking enough oxygen , gas or a customer feeling sick right in the time of departure and that can casade departure delays from the gate for the rest of the days and add sky traffic. That problem would be hard to account for and could cause an issue in our accuracy and precision. 
- The other problem is to be able to capture the impact of the weather either being from the arrival location or departure location would have been hard.
- The final problem is that even with a 20 minuuite departure delay it seems that there is enough cushion in their time schedule that there is rarely any arrival delays unless the departure delay is severe. They under promise and over deliever.
